    <h2>Basic info</h2>

    <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable
        way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and <strong>they reproduce more than any human
            <em>ever</em> has</strong>.</p>

        <h1> A Truth </h1>
        <p>
            <strong> <em> Nobody’s </em>born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do
                algebra.</strong> <br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, <strong> we are born to learn.</strong> <br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> You only have to know <em> one thing:</em> <br>
                You can learn anything. </strong>
